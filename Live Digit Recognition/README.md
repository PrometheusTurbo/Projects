# Handwriting Digit Recognition
This was a project using sklearn to predict handwriting digits. My initial plan was to do it live (meaning that I'd draw the digit on paint and then the model would read that live) but there was a glitch with the library itself which prevented me from doing so. Instead, you can type in what number you want the model to predict and it'll do that for you. Enjoy!
